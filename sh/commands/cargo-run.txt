Run the main binary of the local package (src/main.rs)

Usage:
    cargo run [options] [--] [<args>...]

Options:
    -h, --help              Print this message
    --bin NAME              Name of the bin target to run
    --example NAME          Name of the example target to run
    -j N, --jobs N          The number of jobs to run in parallel
    --release               Build artifacts in release mode, with optimizations
    --features FEATURES     Space-separated list of features to also build
    --no-default-features   Do not build the `default` feature
    --target TRIPLE         Build for the target triple
    --manifest-path PATH    Path to the manifest to execute
    -v, --verbose           Use verbose output
    -q, --quiet             No output printed to stdout
    --color WHEN            Coloring: auto, always, never

If neither `--bin` nor `--example` are given, then if the project only has one
bin target it will be run. Otherwise `--bin` specifies the bin target to run,
and `--example` specifies the example target to run. At most one of `--bin` or
`--example` can be provided.

All of the trailing arguments are passed to the binary to run. If you're passing
arguments to both Cargo and the binary, the ones after `--` go to the binary,
the ones before go to Cargo.
